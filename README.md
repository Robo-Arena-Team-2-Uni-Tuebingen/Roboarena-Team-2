### Sprint 2 (26.04. - 09.05.2023)


#### Arena Refactor
  - implemented ability to manipulate single tiles
  - implemented ability to assign more attributes to tiles
  - reason for this was mostly to lay a foundation for longterm considerations

#### Robot
  - implemented all the required attributes (x,y,r,alpha)
  - minor problems with the alpha attribute, currently it doesn't correctly respond to a input in degrees and requires an input as a fraction of pi instead, fix for that will come with the next sprint
  - minor problems with the flipped y-axis of the drawing, took a while to figure out
